# world-series-wins
 2018 school project to learn ruby

This assignment was meant to teach ruby file input and output as well as to have students practice fleshing out algorithms they would implement before they begin coding. It covered accesseing a file and searching for data within the file to return to the output screen.
This project was one of my earliest and therefore it does not have robust regex and it is repetitive where it need not be (specifically the menu is rather bad). It purely serves as a good measure of my progress as a programmer.
